	<p class="highlight">Anne "Annie"[1] Jacqueline Hathaway was born on November 12, 1982, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Her father Gerald is a labor attorney, and her mother Kate (née McCauley) is a former actress.[2][3] Hathaway's maternal grandfather was WIP (AM) Philadelphia radio personality Joe McCauley.[4] Her mother is of Irish descent, and her father has Irish, French, English, and German ancestry. She was named after Shakespeare's wife.[5] She is the second of three children, following brother Michael and preceding brother Thomas.[6] When she was six, her family moved to the Short Hills[7] area of Millburn, New Jersey, where she was raised.[8]</p>

	<h2>Career</h2>
	<p class="highlight">The comedy The Princess Diaries and the adventure drama The Other Side of Heaven, both 2001 Disney films, featured Hathaway in lead roles. Based on Meg Cabot's 2000 novel of the same name, the former follows teenage Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway) who discovers that she is the heiress to the throne of the fictional Kingdom of Genovia. Hathaway auditioned for the role during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand.[12] Garry Marshall, the film's director, initially considered Liv Tyler for the role, but cast Hathaway after his granddaughters suggested that she had the best "princess" hair.[25] The film became a major commercial success, grossing $165 million worldwide.[26] Many critics praised Hathaway's performance; a BBC critic noted that "Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry" and The New York Times' Elvis Mitchell found her to be "royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features".[27][28] She earned an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female Performance nomination for the role.[29] Hathaway starred with Christopher Gorham in Mitch Davis's The Other Side of Heaven. Inspired by John H. Groberg's memoir In the Eye of the Storm, the film met with mostly negative reviews and was a box-office failure.[30]</p>
	<h2>Public image</h2>
	<p class= "highlight">Describing Hathaway's off-screen persona, John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph wrote in 2014 that she is a "well-grounded, friendly young woman with a good sense of humour, a wide smile and an easy-going attitude".[182] He opines that despite considerable success she has never "gone Hollywood", staying close to her friends.[182] The authors of the book 365 Style note Hathaway's girl next door image, and her The Intern director Nancy Meyers says she is "wise beyond her years".[183][184] The journalist Laura Brown finds her to be a "sincere", "warm and funny" woman.[185] After her 2013 Golden Globe acceptance speech for Les Misérables, some members of the media began to dismiss her as "too-actress-y, over-eager" and inauthentic.[186] Addressing this, Hathaway said in 2014 that she feels anxious when public speaking but has since grown from it and become a more compassionate person.[185] Regarding her perceived image, she says, "People have this idea of me as just being a very prim, professional girl, which I suppose I am, but I do cut loose and have fun in my life".[5]</p>
